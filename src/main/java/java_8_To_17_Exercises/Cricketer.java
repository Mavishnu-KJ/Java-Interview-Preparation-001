    Instance methods in records work almost identically to instance methods in normal classes:

    => They have access to this
    => They can access the record components (name(), centuries())
    => They can have parameters
    => They can return any type
    => They can throw exceptions
    => if the record implements an interface with default methods, those can be overridden in the record itself
    => Methods from Object (toString, equals, hashCode) can also be overridden in the record.
